(1,'This article aims at the integration of communities of practice into work processes. Linear structures are often inappropriate for the execution of knowledge intensive tasks and work processes. The latter are characterized by non-linear sequences and dynamic, social interaction. But for the work in communities of practice the leading path, that is needed for structuring the work, is often missing. Our article exposes the requirements in order to integrate the dynamic, social processes of the knowledge generation in communities of practice with formal described knowledge intensive processes. For the support of communities the Wiki-concept is introduced. In order to integrate communities into process structures a concept for an appropriate interface is presented. On the basis of this interface concept an information retrieval algorithm is used to connect the process-oriented structures with community-oriented structures. The prototype realisation of this concept is shown by a short example.'),

(3,'E-learning at the workplace might be accomplished by synchronous cooperative learning sessions of small groups using net-based communication. This form of learning is suitable both for course-based e-learning as well as for knowledge transfer within the company. The small groups learn self-regulated, i.e. without the guidance of an instructor. However, the learning tasks are pre-defined and a specific learning process is precisely described. In the present study, the goal of the cooperative learning sessions is to deepen pre-existing declarative knowledge. During cooperative learning, group members are required to actively use, acquire, enrich and exchange their knowledge. In a field study carried out in a large software company, a software tool was used which supported the specific process by phase-specific delivering of instructions and learning materials as well as by means of process control (including turn-taking, role assignment, and coordination of task flow). The results of the empirical evaluation demonstrate a high amount of topic-oriented contributions and the realization of the expected learning activities. However, feedback data indicated a low acceptance of the software tool because of its restrictive process control. It is discussed that there might have been a non-optimal interaction between the factors technology and target group in the study.'),
(4,'There are various Knowledge Management Systems available currently and designed to support knowledge sharing and learning. An example of these are Experience-based Information Systems in the domain of Software Engineering, i.e., Information Systems designed to support experience management. Lately, these have become more and more sophisticated from a technical point of view. However, there are several shortcomings that appear to limit the input, the content of these systems and their usage. The problems identified in this paper relate to knowledge acquisition, learning issues, as well as to the users\'  motivation and trust. We introduce an approach meant to enhance the content of the experience base and improve learning from experiences within information spaces, namely weblogs that are maintained during daily work and serve as input for both an experience base and for an information element base. In order to enhance learning, a pedagogical information agent is envisaged for retrieving suitable experiences to be further enriched with additional information elements and produce micro-didactical learning arrangements. In addition we consider the relevance of motivation and trust issues. An empirical study demonstrates that using weblogs for such an approach is feasible.'),
(5,'Process-oriented Knowledge Management aims to provide adequate information for employees, especially in weakly structured and information-intensive business processes. Beside a technical software solution, which uses a pre-structured, context-aware and collaborative information space that combines processes, domain specific semantic structures and document parts, this requires a methodology to model the process and other context-dimensions, such as roles. Moreover, a guideline and clear service modules are necessary to introduce process-oriented Knowledge Management in companies, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Such solutions were developed in the cooperative research project <u>PreBIS</u> (Pre-<u>Build</u> Information Space).'),
(6,'This article introduces two theoretical concepts for the emerging field Knowledge Visualization and discusses a new visualization application that was used to communicate a long-term project to various stakeholders in an organization. First, we introduce a theoretical framework and a model for Knowledge Visualization. The framework and the model identify and relate the key-aspects for successful Knowledge Visualization applications. Next, we present an evaluation of an implemented Knowledge Visualization application: The Tube Map Visualization. A quality development process had to be established in an education centre for health care professions. Traditional project plans, flyers, and mails did not manage to get the attention, did present overview and detail insufficiently, and did not motivate the employees for actions. Because Visual Metaphors are effective for Knowledge Communication we developed a customized Knowledge Map based on the tube system metaphor. The Tube Map Visualization illustrates the whole project, where each tube line represents a target group and each station a milestone. The visualization was printed as a poster and displayed at prominent locations in the organization. The findings of an evaluation indicate that the Tube Map Visualization is a powerful metaphor to communicate a complex project to different target groups and to build up a mutual story. The employees considered it useful because it provides overview and detailed information in one image and because it initiates discussion. The Tube Map Visualization is therefore helpful to complement traditional project plans of (1) <i>long-term projects</i> where (2) <i>different stakeholders</i> are involved. The theoretical framework, the model, and the findings have implications for researchers in the fields of Knowledge Management, Knowledge Visualization, Information Visualization, and Communication Sciences.'),
(7,'Current trends in collaborative knowledge management emphasize the importance of inter- and intra-organizational business process support. Enactment of business processes has primarily been a domain of workflow management systems. In this paper we propose a hybrid architecture for reconciliation of knowledge management and workflow management systems in order to support process participants in organizations, who are increasingly distributed and need to share and distribute knowledge artifacts. Today one pressing challenge is to utilize software as to create, share, and exchange (knowledge) work in collaborative knowledge activities across locations, while still being business process aware. This paper develops a conceptual framework, discusses a software architecture, and presents examples of a software system implementation for activity-based knowledge management for global project teams.'),
(8,'A well-functioning Knowledge Management is a competitive advantage for enterprises that act in co-operative and distributed networks with knowledge intensive production processes. A Knowledge Management approach that integrates both, hard factors (e.g. Information Technology) and soft factors (e.g., cultural aspects) for distributed and dynamic entrepreneurial (inter-organisational) networks is currently missing. This paper presents research findings of a project that is developing a methodology as well as an appropriate toolkit to support a service provider responsible for the KM within distributed entrepreneurial networks. The project integrates explicitly both new Information and Communication Technology driven organisational concepts, human-oriented approaches and existing KM methodologies and instruments.'),
(9,'Existing approaches in the area of knowledge-intensive processes focus on integrated knowledge and process management systems, the support of processes with KM systems, or the analysis of knowledge-intensive activities. For capturing knowledge-intensive business processes well known and established methods do not meet the requirements of a comprehensive and integrated approach of process-oriented knowledge management. These approaches are not able to visualise the decisions, actions and measures which are causing the sequence of the processes in an adequate manner. Parallel to conventional processes knowledge-intensive processes exist. These processes are based on conversions of knowledge within these processes. To fill these gaps in modelling knowledge-intensive business processes the Knowledge Modelling and Description Language (KMDL) got developed. The KMDL is able to represent the development, use, offer and demand of knowledge along business processes. Further it is possible to show the existing knowledge conversions which take place additionally to the normal business processes. The KMDL can be used to formalise knowledge-intensive processes with a focus on certain knowledge-specific characteristics and to identify process improvements in these processes. The KMDL modelling tool K-Modeler is introduced for a computer-aided modelling and analysing. The technical framework and the most important functionalities to support the analysis of the captured processes are introduced in the following contribution.'),
(10,'Knowledge technologies, the software products that support all aspects of knowledge processing and exchange, are the subject of permanent interest for software engineers at research organizations, as well as, for market analysts in commercial organizations. In order to clarify the role of knowledge management solutions in an enterprise business process, in this paper we survey the market of knowledge management solutions and analyze their functionalities from operational and strategic business perspective. Although knowledge flows are identified on an operational level, discussion will show that knowledge management solutions here serve to utilize the enterprise knowledge in an efficient performance of daily work. We argue that data and information collected on the operational level are processed by knowledge management solutions on a strategic level thus creating new knowledge that is used for strategic management of customers, suppliers and partners. This paper gives an insight into knowledge management market that can help the strategic planners to easily begin a knowledge management initiative.'),
(11,'During the last years, a large number of information and communication technologies (ICT) have been proposed to be supportive of knowledge management (KM). Several KM instruments have been developed and implemented in many organizations that require support by ICT. Recently, many of these technologies are bundled in the form of comprehensive, enterprise-wide knowledge infrastructures. The implementation of both, instruments and infrastructures, requires adequate modeling techniques that consider the specifics of modeling context in knowledge work. The paper studies knowledge work, KM instruments and knowledge infrastructures. Modeling techniques are reviewed, especially for business process management and activity theory. The concept of knowledge stance is discussed in order to relate functions from process models to actions from activity theory, thus detailing the context relevant for knowledge work.'),
(12,'Business Process Execution Business Process Execution typically represents technological knowledge infrastructures that leverage available formal, contextual information of business processes (from e.g. Workflow Management Systems) to provide relevant knowledge to process agents.  The paper _Process Oriented Knowledge Management: A Service Based Approach_ by Robert Woitsch and Dimitris Karagiannis introduces PROMOTE, a framework and a platform enabling and supporting the execution of knowledge intensive business processes. The authors utilize semantic technologies and vector functions in order to match knowledge management requirements and knowledge management services. An introduced concept for a service-based and process oriented architecture of an enterprise knowledge management system integrates the elements of the theoretical framework. _Reconciling Knowledge Management and Workflow Management Systems: The Activity-Based Knowledge Management Approach_ by Schahram Dustdar introduces _Caramba_, an activity based knowledge management approach. Based on a framework that classifies different knowledge management technologies, the author motivates the need for a consideration of activities as the central concept for the integration of knowledge and workflow management systems. The presented Caramba software demonstrates the viability of the introduced concepts. _Modeling and Implementing Pre-built Information Spaces. Architecture and Methods for Process Oriented Knowledge Management_ by Karsten Boehm, Wolf Engelbach, Joerg Haertwig, Martin Wilcken and Martin Delp presents _PREBIS_, an implementation of a business process oriented knowledge infrastructure that focuses on information provision for process agents based on contextual information about the user. The authors introduce the PREBIS modules, the kernel and a phase model that allow for the configuration of pre-built information spaces. An evaluation indicates the practical applicability of the PREBIS implementation. We hope that this special issue gives the reader an insightful overview of current concepts, methods and implementations in the emerging area of business process oriented knowledge infrastructures.

(13,'This paper explores a process view of call-centres and the knowledge infrastructures that support these processes. As call-centres grow and become more complex in their function and organisation so do the knowledge infrastructures required to support their size and complexity. This study suggests a knowledge-based hierarchy of advice-type call-centres and discusses associated knowledge management strategies for different sized centres. It introduces a Knowledge Infrastructure Hierarchy model, with which it is possible to analyze and classify call-centre knowledge infrastructures. The model also demonstrates different types of interventions supporting knowledge management in call-centres. Finally the paper discusses the possibilities of applying traditional maturity model approaches in this context.'),

These algorithms are executed in a highly concurrent fashion by an unknown number of such independent processes. These algorithms have been first presented in [MS96] by M.M. Michael and M.L. Scott. Two other developments of the same algorithms have been proposed recently in [YS03] (using the 3VMC Model Checker developed by E. Yahav) and in [DGLM04] (using I/O Automata and PVS).'),

(17,'Using the fiction of atomicity as a design abstraction and then refining atomicity as we develop an implementation is widely used in areas of concurrent computing such as database systems and transaction processing. In each of these and similar areas, associated notions of correctness are used in order to show that a particular implementation artefact which exhibits concurrency is correct in some sense with respect to a (possibly notional) description which executes with a greater degree of sequentiality. Of crucial importance in the proof and deployment of such notions of correctness is the issue of observability: i.e. in what broad sense do (human or computer) users of a particular implementation artefact observe the effects of its executions. For example, if a human user is allowed to observe directly the execution of a particular concurrent component then he or she will be able to detect the fact of concurrent - and so non-atomic - execution. In general, however, the notion of observability is treated implicitly or not at all. In this paper, we make it explicit and look at the issue of exploring more fully the connections between atomicity and observability. The ultimate aim of this consideration is to work towards constructing a more general framework for (software or hardware) development by refining atomicity.'),
(18,'In an ideal world, where we could guarantee instantaneous, atomic data transfer - whatever the type of the data being transferred - shared memory communication between two concurrent processes could be implemented directly using single variables or registers, without any attendant access control policies or mechanisms. In practice, asynchronous communication mechanisms may be used to provide the illusion of atomic transfers of data while still allowing non-blocking reads and writes: that is, reads and writes may proceed concurrently without interfering with each other. In order to prove the correctness of such mechanisms, the natural approach would be to verify them against the specification provided by an idealised register with atomic, instantaneous - and so sequential - transfers of data. Yet such a verification is complicated by the fact that, in moving to the asynchronous communication mechanism from such a specification, additional concurrency has been introduced and so the (visible) behaviours of the mechanism are not directly comparable to those of the register. In this paper, we recall an extension of standard process algebraic refinement and show how it may be used to verify the correctness of a particular asynchronous communication mechanism, Simpson s 4-slot. In so doing, we look at a number of issues which seem significant in the consideration of correctness when the real atomicity of a specification has been relaxed in the move from specification to implementation.'),
(19,'We describe the StAC language which can be used to specify the orchestration of activities in long running business transactions. Long running business transactions use compensation to cope with exceptions. StAC supports sequential and parallel behaviour as well as exception and compensation handling. We also show how the B notation may be combined with StAC to specify the data aspects of transactions. The combination of StAC and B provides a rich formal notation which allows for succinct and precise specification of business transactions. BPEL is an industry standard language for specifying business transactions and includes compensation constructs. We show how a substantial subset of BPEL can be mapped to StAC thus demonstrating the expressiveness of StAC and providing a formal semantics for BPEL.'),

(22,'This paper shows how the concept of atomicity can ease the development of concurrent software. It illustrates by means of a case study how atomicity is used to reduce the complexity of concurrency by presenting simplified models or views of the system at certain stages of the development cycle. As the development process goes on, the atomic views from the early stages are refined - broken up into smaller pieces - to slowly introduce concurrency back into the system. Finally, at the design stage, low-level concepts that provide atomicity, such as transaction or monitors, are used to ensure consistent concurrent updating of the application state.'),

This ability can be   used quite straightforwardly to identify structure in a data set   when it is two or three dimensional. With data sets with more than 3   dimensions some kind of transformation is always necessary. In this   paper we review in depth and present and extension of one of these   mechanisms: Andrews\' curves. With the Andrews\' curves we use a curve   to represent each data point. A human can run his eye along a set of   curves (representing the members of the data set) and identify   particular regions of the curves which are optimal for identifying   clusters in the data set.

In this work, we   introduce a novel framework which allows visualization to take place   in the background of normal day to day operations of any GUI based   operating system such as MS Windows, OS X or Linux. Our system works   by replacing the standard file icons with automatically generated   icons that reflect the contents of the files in a principled way. We   call such icons Intelligent Icons. While there is little utility in   examining an individual icon, examining groups of them provides a   greater possibility of unexpected and serendipitous discoveries. The   utility of Intelligent Icons can be further enhanced by arranging   them on the screen in a way that reflects their   similarity/differences. We demonstrate the utility of our approach   on data as diverse as DNA, text files, electrocardiograms, and Space   Shuttle telemetry. In addition we show that our system is unique in   also supporting fast and intuitive similarity search.'),

Visual data exploration techniques provide   the user with graphic views or metaphors that represent potential   patterns and data relationships. However, an only image does not   always convey high-dimensional data properties successfully. From   such data sets, visualization techniques have to deal with the curse   of dimensionality in a critical way, as the number of examples may   be very small with respect to the number of attributes. In this   work, we describe a visual exploration technique that automatically   extracts relevant attributes and displays their ranges of interest   in order to support two data mining tasks: classification and   feature selection.

(31,'During the last decade Visual Exploration and Visual Data Mining techniques have proven to be of high value in exploratory data analysis since they combine human visual perception and recognition capabilities with the enormous storage capacity and the computational power of today\'s computer systems in order to detect patterns and trends in the data. But the ever increasing mass of information leads to new challenges on visualization techniques and concepts. Due to technological progress in computer power and storage capacity today\'s scientific and commercial applications are capable of generating, storing and processing massive amounts of data. Most existing visualization metaphors and concepts do not scale well on such large data sets as interaction capabilities and visual representations suffer from the massive number of data points. To bridge this gap, Visual Analytics aim to incorporate more intelligent means than to just retrieve and display the data items to filter the relevant from the non-relevant data. In this context the paper introduces a new approach based on a Multiresolution paradigm to increase the scalability of existing Visual data exploration techniques. The basic idea is to provide relevance driven compact representations of the underlying data set that present the data at different granularities. In the visualization step the available display space is then distributed according to the data granularity, to emphasize relevant information. The paper aims at introducing a technical base of Multiresolution visualization and provides an application example that shows the usefulness of the proposed approach.'),

We have focused our attention on Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), at the state of the art security policies evaluation is manually performed by technical and organizational people coming from the domains that need to interoperate. However, policy evaluation must face uncertainties derived from different perspectives, verbal judgments and lack of information. Fuzzy techniques and uncertainty reasoning can provide a meaningful way for dealing with these issues. In this paper we propose a fuzzy technique to characterize a policy and to define a Reference Evaluation Model representing different security levels against which we are able to evaluate and compare policies. The comparison takes into account not only minimal system needs but evaluator s severity, too, furthermore it gives clear information regarding policy weakness that could be used to help security administrators to better enforce rules.

(37,'Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are responsible  for monitoring and analyzing host or network activity to detect intrusions in order to protect information from unauthorized access or manipulation. There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature_based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly_based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.'),

Due to the high frequency of mobility, attrition and reinforcement in ad hoc networks, in order to preserve confidentiality, it becomes necessary to rekey each time a member enters or leaves a logically defined group. We compare our group rekeying rate on sliding window protocol versus other kinds of Rekeying algorithms. The proposed sliding window protocol performs better. The proposed sliding window is therefore simple and improves both communications and security performance.'),

(47,'Contemporary distributed software systems, exposed  to highly unpredictable environments, are reaching extremely high complexity levels. For example, open heterogeneous multi-agent systems that may potentially be spread all around the globe are interacting with different types of dynamically changing web-services and web-technologies. Traditional control-based handling of adaptability may not be suitable any more in such systems. Therefore there is a tendency for exploring different adaptability models inspired by biological phenomena. Biological systems inherently are faced with complexity and unpredictable environments, and they exhibit high levels of ad aptability. In this article, we present a theoretical model of development of complex system, which was built originally by Andrzej Gecow, as a computational model in evolutionary biology. This model represents a generic complex system subjected to long sequences of adaptive changes. The model was used for analysis of development processes and also structural tendencies. By tendencies we mean some phenomena that should be expected in any complex system, subjected to a long development process. Some of these tendencies are not desirable, for example bloat of the system. Some of the phenomena, however, show characteristics of changes that improve the system. These characteristics can be applied to optimisation of self-producing and self-adapting algorithms of self-maintaining complex software systems. The main structural tendencies described in this article are: terminal modifications, terminal majority of additions, and covering (reconstructing within the system itself disappearing environmental signals).'),

The accepted model for the internal cognitive space reflects basic structural properties of human cognition and assumes the partition of cognitive phenomena into conscious and non-conscious. The language is treated as a set of semiotic symbols and is used in semantic communication. Semiotic symbols are related to the internal content of empirical knowledge bases in which they are grounded. This relation is given by the so-called epistemic satisfaction relations defining situations in which semiotic symbols are adequate (grounded) representations of embodied experience. The importance of non-conscio us embodied knowledge in language grounding and production is accepted.

This paper describes an approach to the problem of estimating time costs of actor programs. The approach takes into account the constraints imposed both by the semantics and implementation of the model. In particular, implementation constraints can be captured and exploited to drastically reduce the number of computations generable by the program, thus simplifying the execution time evaluation. Moreover, execution times are expressed in a parametric form by using a variant of the <i>LogP</i> model able to synthetically characterize the target hardware/software platform.'),

(57,'One of the major difficulties in software testing is the automatic generation of test data that satisfy a given adequacy criterion. This paper presents an automatic test data generation technique that uses a genetic algorithm (GA), which is guided by the data flow dependencies in the program, to search for test data to cover its def-use associations. The GA conducts its search by constructing new test data from previously generated test data that are evaluated as effective test data. The approach can be used in test data generation for programs with/without loops and procedures. The proposed GA accepts as input an instrumented version of the program to be tested, the list of def-use associations to be covered, the number of input variables, and the domain and precision of each input variable. The algorithm produces a set of test cases, the set of def-use associations covered by each test case, and a list of uncovered def-use associations, if any. In the parent selection process, the GA uses one of two methods: the roulette wheel method or a proposed method, called the random selection method, according to the user choice. Finally, the paper presents the results of the experiments that have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GA compared to the random testing technique, and to compare the proposed random selection method to the roulette wheel method.'),

In principle, transclusions are used in HTML for the inclusion of entire text documents, images, movies and similar media. The HTML specification only takes transclusions of entire documents into account, though. Hence it is not possible, for instance, to include a part of an existing image into an HTML document. In this paper, fine-grained transclusion of multimedia documents on the Web are proposed, which presents a logical realisation of the concept of transclusions in HTML. The proposal makes it possible, for instance, to include sections of existing images or small portions of entire movies into HTML documents. Two different approaches to implementing the functionality presented are detailed. The first architecture is based on a transparent extension module to conventional HTTP servers, whereas the alternative design makes use of a CGI program. Both approaches are fully self-contained, reside on an HTTP server and do not require browser plug-ins or any other special software components to be installed on client computers. An amendment to the HTTP specification is not required either. A prototype implementation demonstrates the proposal for a number of document types.'),

The TESTAF framework requires a VDM++ specification for a class, a corresponding implementation in C++, and a test specification, to generate and execute test cases, and evaluate the results. The test specification defines valid test sequences in an intermediate specification language based on regular expressions. The framework uses the formal specification of the class, and the test specification to generate empty test shells, which are then filled in with the test data to create concrete test cases. The test data for a method are generated from the input space defined by the method pre condition and the class invariant. The TESTAF applies boundary value analysis strategy to generate the test data. A test driver then executes the implementation with the test data, and uses a conjunction of method post condition and the class invariant as a test oracle to evaluate the results, while reporting failed test cases to the user.'),

(83,'This paper presents a system for induction of forest of functional trees from data streams able to detect concept drift. The Ultra Fast Forest of Trees (UFFT) is an incremental algorithm, which works online, processing each example in constant time, and performing a single scan over the training examples. It uses analytical techniques to choose the splitting criteria, and the information gain to estimate the merit of each possible splitting-test. For multi-class problems the algorithm builds a binary tree for each possible pair of classes, leading to a forest of trees. Decision nodes and leaves contain naive-Bayes classifiers playing different roles during the induction process. Naive-Bayes in leaves are used to classify test examples. Naive-Bayes in inner nodes play two different roles. They can be used as multivariate splitting-tests if chosen by the splitting criteria, and used to detect changes in the class-distribution of the examples that traverse the node. When a change in the class-distribution is detected, all the sub-tree rooted at that node will be pruned. The use of naive­Bayes classifiers at leaves to classify test examples, the use of splitting-tests based on the outcome of naive-Bayes, and the use of naive-Bayes classifiers at decision nodes to detect changes in the distribution of the examples are directly obtained from the sufficient statistics required to compute the splitting criteria, without no additional computations.

The principal point of departure are social theories of learning and the theories of organisational knowledge creation. The focus is on models for the exchange and sharing of implicit knowledge. A model of personalised learning knowledge maps is presented as one possible way of addressing the problem of capturing, visualising and sharing implicit knowledge of a community of users. In particular, we discuss how this model resolves one critical shortcoming of the existing socialisation and externalisation approaches: the creation of a semantic representation of a shared understanding of the community which reflects implicit knowledge and incorporates personal views of individual users. Finally, we outline the application to a real-world interdisciplinary Internet platform netzspannung.org.'),

We present a number of results using different combinations of evolution rules (catalytic, non-cooperative) and the weight of the symport/antiport rules. In particular, we show that using non-cooperative rules and antiports of unbounded weight makes it possible to obtain at least the Parikh set of ET0L languages. On the other hand, using catalytic rules (one catalyst) and antiports of weight 2, these system become universal. Several open problems are also presented.'),

(192,'The increasing popularity of SAT and BDD techniques in formal hardware verification and automated synthesis of logic circuits encourages the search for additional speedups. Since typical SAT and BDD algorithms are exponential in the worst-case, the structure of realworld instances is a natural source of improvements. While SAT and BDD techniques are often presented as mutually exclusive alternatives, our work points out that both can be improved via the use of the same structural properties of instances. Our proposed methods are based on efficient problem partitioning and can be easily applied as pre-processing with arbitrary SAT solvers and BDD packages without modifying the source code of SAT/BDD tools. <br><br>      Finding a better variable ordering is a well recognized problem for both SAT solvers and BDD packages. Currently, the best variable-ordering algorithms are dynamic, in the sense that they are invoked many times in the course of the host algorithm that solves SAT or manipulates BDDs. Examples include the DLCS ordering for SAT solvers and variable sifting during BDD manipulations. In this work we propose a universal variable-ordering algorithm MINCE (MIN Cut Etc.) that pre-processes a given Boolean formula in CNF. MINCE is completely independent from target SAT algorithms and in some cases outperforms both the variable state independent decaying sum (VSIDS) decision heuristic for SAT and variable sifting for BDDs. We argue that MINCE tends to capture structural properties of Boolean functions arising from real-world applications. Our contribution is validated on the ISCAS circuits and the DIMACS benchmarks.

The idea is to perform a low-cost preprocessing that will statically induce global signal relationships into the original CNF formula of the miter circuit under verification, and hence reduce the complexity of the SAT instance. This efficient and effective preprocessing quickly builds up the implication graph for the miter circuit under verification, yielding a large set of direct, indirect and extended backward implications. These two-node implications spanning the entire circuit are converted into binary clauses, and they are added to the miter CNF formula. The added clauses constrain the search space of the SAT solver and provide correlation among the different variables, which enhances the Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP). Experimental results on large and difficult ISCAS\'85, ISC AS\'89 (full scan) and ITC\'99 (full scan) CEC instances show that our approach is independent of the state-of-the-art SAT solver used, and that the added clauses help to achieve not eworthy speedup for each of the cases.

(209,'We present an embedded_system design flow, discuss its details, and demonstrate its advantages. We adopt the object_oriented methodology for the system_level model because software dominates hardware in embedded systems and the object_oriented methodology is already established for software design and reuse. As the building_block of system implementation, we synthesise application_specific processors that are reusable, through programming, for several related applications. This addresses the high cost and risk of manufacturing specialised hardware tailored to only a single application. Both the processor and its software are generated from the model of the system by the synthesis and compilation procedures provided. We observe that the key point in object_oriented methodology is the class library, and hence, we implement methods of the class library as the instruction_set of the processor. This allows the processor to be synthesised just once, but, by programming, to be reused several times and specialised to new applications that use the same class library. An important point here is that the processor allows its instructions to be selectively overridden by software routines, this not only allows augmentation of processor capabilities in software, but also enables a structured approach to make software patches to faulty or outdated hardware. A case study illustrates application of the methodology to various applications modelled on top of a common basis class library, and moreover, demonstrates new application_specific opportunities in power management (and area_management for FPGA implementations) resulting from the structure of the processor based on de_activation of unused features.'),
(210,'The specification and validation of security protocols often requires viewing function calls - like encryption/decryption and the generation of fake messages - explicitly as actions within the process semantics. Following this approach, this paper introduces a symbolic framework based on value-passing processes able to handle symbolic values like fresh nonces, fresh keys, fake addresses and fake messages. The main idea in our approach is to assign to each value-passing process a formula describing the symbolic values conveyed by its semantics. In such symbolic processes, called <i>constrained processes</i>, the formulas are drawn from a logic based on a message algebra equipped with encryption, signature and hashing primitives. The symbolic operational semantics of a constrained process is then established through semantic rules updating formulas by adding restrictions over the symbolic values, as required for the process to evolve. We then prove that the logic required from the semantic rules is decidable. We also define a bisimulation equivalence between constrained processes, this amounts to a generalisation of the standard bisimulation equivalence between (non-symbolic) value-passing processes. Finally, we provide a complete symbolic bisimulation method for constructing the bisimulation between constrained processes.'),

The first theme gives examples of using HR and training instruments to support knowledge management. The second theme represents cases of using KM methods (namely a community of practice) to support HR learning management efforts. The last theme describes how KM and HR/learning teams could work on joint initiatives. Then we discuss the added value of the scenarios and propose further practical steps and research directions.'),

(263,'Algorithmic research is an established knowledge engineering process that has allowed researchers to identify new or significant problems, to better understand existing approaches and experimental results, and to obtain new, effective and efficient solutions. While algorithmic researchers regularly contribute to this knowledge base by proposing new problems and novel solutions, the processes currently used to share this knowledge are inefficient, resulting in unproductive overhead. Most of these publication-centred processes lack explicit high-level knowledge structures to support efficient knowledge management. The authors describe a problem-centred collaborative knowledge management architecture associated with Computational Problem Solving (CPS). Specifically we articulate the structure and flow of such knowledge by making in-depth analysis of the needs of algorithmic researchers, and then extract the ontology. We also propose a knowledge flow measurement methodology to provide human-centred evaluations of research activities within the knowledge structure. This measurement enables us to highlight active research topics and to identify influential researchers. The collaborative knowledge management architecture was realized by implementing an Open Computational Problem Solving (OpenCPS) Knowledge Portal, which is an open-source project accessible at http://www.opencps.org.'),

(268,'Modern computational Problem Solving Environments (PSEs) become more and more complex and knowledge intensive in terms of their integrated toolsets, in particular for engineering design search and optimization. Whether these toolsets can be assembled effectively to produce satisfactory results depends heavily on using the best domain practice and following decisions made by skilled engineers in practical situations. In this paper, a knowledge based approach is used to acquire this knowledge from existing sources and model it in a maintainable fashion. Ontologies are used to develop the conceptualization of a knowledge base. In order to reuse this knowledge to provide guidance at knowledge intensive points, we propose a knowledge based advisor, which can give a context-aware critique to guide users through effective operations of building domain workflows. The concept of a state panel is proposed to collect system state information, which is then reasoned about together with various task models in the JESS (Java Expert System Shell) environment. Two reasoning strategies are designed for different advising styles. A multilayer and client-server style architecture is proposed to illustrate how this advisor can be deployed to make available its knowledge advising service to a real workflow construction PSE in a maintainable fashion. Throughout we use the example of these knowledge services in the context of design optimization in engineering.'),
(269,'The increasing complexity of both the environment in which companies operate and of their internal workings combined with an increasingly high pressure for innovation make knowledge and its efficient management central to business success today. The management of knowledge is more than directly managing knowledge as a resource. It is more concerned with providing knowledge-friendly environments in which knowledge can flourish and develop. The development of such environments can be addressed from many different perspectives, which makes knowledge management a very interdisciplinary field of research. It concerns human resources management, organizational development and information technology management to mention just the three most important fields.  This special issue on hot spots in knowledge management offers the reader a broad overview of the leading edge developments, technologies and applications in knowledge management. The issue serves two distinct purposes: (1) It may help shaping the reader s thinking in the way required for a successful implementation of knowledge management in an organization, (2) it may serve as a stimulus for the reader s research in knowledge management. The following 13 papers fall in four categories:  Knowledge Management in Business  Knowledge Mining  Knowledge Representation  Convergence of Knowledge Management with other Domains  The first category - knowledge management in business - addresses knowledge management from a more business-oriented perspective. In more detail, the papers of this group address the following topics:  Peter Schuett from IBM Stuttgart (Germany) presents in his paper The post-Nonaka Knowledge Management a new generation of knowledge management that can be divided in three categories (1) processes, (2) organization and culture, and (3) information technology. The objective of the paper is to provide solutions for increasing the productivity of knowledge workers through knowledge management.  He argues that in order to increase productivity we need to understand the work environment of knowledge workers. To provide guidance, P. Schuett identifies 11 factors which help understanding and improving a knowledge worker s environment. This factors fall in the following three groups work processes, organisation and culture, and information technology.  Klaus North and Tina Hornung from the University of Applied Sciences in Wiesbaden (Germany) entitled their paper The Benefits of Knowledge Management - Results from the German award _Knowledge Manager 2002_. Based on the evaluation of almost 40 companies the authors present which added-value and benefit knowledge management can generate. The benefits are grouped in the following five perspectives: learn and growth, business processes, customer satisfaction, financial results, and employee satisfaction. The results of the study revealed that knowledge management can generate the highest benefit in business processes (e.g. acceleration and higher transparency), customer satisfaction (e.g. better response times), and employee satisfaction (e.g. improved team work and increased motivation).  The paper Managing Operation Knowledge for the Metal Industry written by Sheng-Tun Li and Huang-Chih Hseih from the National Kaohsiung First University of Science Technology (Taiwan) presents a three-stage life cycle for the ontology design.

(273,'This paper will study the influence of three components of human capital focusing on operative personnel under a dynamic perspective. It considers learning flows and the knowledge stocks that the employees of the organization generate because of the relationships that they maintain with their clients. The influence of individual knowledge in these learning flows will be examined. These being components such as: learning capacities, automatic and conscious knowledge, on the flows of the relational learning process including transfer, transformation and harvesting phases of knowledge. In order to study the relative importance of the individual knowledge components in each phase of the relational process, the scale established by [Kohli and Jaworski 1990] will be used in this research. The paper is structured in four parts. In the first, a theoretical reference on individual knowledge on the relational learning process will be established. In the second part, some hypothesis and the necessary methodology will be proposed. In the third part the results will be shown and finally, in the conclusions some interesting aspects on the role of individual knowledge in the process described will be shown. Conclusions are based on a study of eighty-four organizations. This investigation establishes important conclusions on the role of individual knowledge in the generation of the customer capital. Concretely, the explicit knowledge of the employees is the most meaningful in the relational learning process, although it is also true that the tacit knowledge and individual learning capacities have a special importance in the harvesting phase of knowledge.'),

From this framework, a methodology for assessing competencies in dynamic work domains is developed which utilises documents employees have created to assess the competencies they have been acquiring. By means of a case study, we show how the methodology and the resulting structures can be validated in an organisational setting. From the resulting structures, employee competency profiles can be derived and development planning can be supported.

Traditional run-time monitoring however, is limited to observing sequences of pure Boolean propositions. This paper describes tools for observing temporal properties over time series, namely, sequences of propositions with constraints on data value changes over time. Using such Temporal Logic with time Series (TLS), it is possible to monitor important properties such as stability, monotonicity, temporal average and sum values, and temporal min/max values. The specification and monitoring of linear time temporal logic with real-time and time series constraints are supported by the Temporal Rover and the DBRover, which are in-process and remote run-time monitoring tools. The novel TLS extension described in this paper is based on practical experience and feedback provided by NASA engineers after using the DBRover to verify flight code. The paper also presents a novel hybrid approach to verify timing properties in rapid system prototyping that combines the traditional schedulability analysis of the design and the monitoring of timing constraint satisfaction during prototype execution based on a time-series temporal logic.

Coalgebras are particularly suited for describing state-based systems. This makes formally defining state-based Rosetta quite straightforward.

(324,'This paper proposes a general discussion of the handling of imprecise and uncertain information in temporal reasoning in the framework of fuzzy sets and possibility theory. The introduction of fuzzy features in temporal reasoning can be related to different issues. First, it can be motivated by the need of a gradual, linguistic-like description of temporal relations even in the face of complete information. An extension of Allen relational calculus is proposed, based on fuzzy comparators expressing linguistic tolerance. Fuzzy Allen relations are defined from a fuzzy partition made by three possible fuzzy relations between dates (<i>approximately equal, clearly smaller,</i> and <i>clearly greater</i>). Second, the handling of fuzzy or incomplete information leads to pervade classical Allen relations, and more generally fuzzy Allen relations, with uncertainty. The paper provides a detailed presentation of the calculus of fuzzy Allen relations (including the composition table of these relations). Moreover, the paper discusses the patterns for propagating uncertainty about (fuzzy) Allen relations in a possibilistic way.'),

However, describing an image fully and adequately with metadata is practically not possible. The other alternative is describing image content by its low-level features such as color, texture, shape, etc. and using the same for similarity-based image retrieval. However, practice has shown that using only the low-level features can not as well be complete. Hence, systems need to integrate both low-level and metadata descriptions for an efficient image data management. However, due to lack of adequate image data model, absence of a formal algebra for content-based image operations, and lack of precision of the existing image processing and retrieval techniques, no much work is done to integrate the use of low-level and metadata description and retrieval methods.

Developing original content is time consuming and expensive. To offset the cost, we present a novel framework, viz. SEAL (SEmantic portAL), that builds on Semantic Web standards. We illustrate our approach with examples from the OntoWeb community portal. Community web sites exhibit two dominating properties: They often need to integrate many different information sources and they require an adequate web site management system. SEAL exploits ontologies for fulfilling the requirements set forth by these two properties. Ontologies provide a high level of sophistication for web information integration as well as for web site management.'),

(368,'ATM virtual path (VP) contains bundles of virtual channels (VCs). A VP layer network can be used as a server layer network of VC layer networks and each VC layer network can be a client layer. Therefore the effective provision of VC services can be achieved by a better routing scheme of the VP layer network. However, the traditional hierarchical routing scheme of PNNI signaling protocol does not provide the globally optimal route in hierarchical transport network due to its successive network partitioning and topology abstraction. We propose a new VP routing scheme suitable for a nation-wide hierarchical transport network and a network model suitable for the scalable VP network management system. The routing algorithm can provide the globally optimal route in the hierarchical network environment from the perspectives of maximization of network resource utilization and satisfaction of the end user s QoS requirement. In addition, we describe the implementation model of the ATM virtual path network management system (VP-NMS). Lastly, we show the routing performance evaluated in the High Speed Information Network (HSIN) of Korea Telecom.'),

More than 90 percent of the 77 plagiarisms within our various benchmark program sets are reliably detected and a majority of the others at least raise suspicion. The run time is just a few seconds for submissions of 100 programs of several hundred lines each.

Our paper is an attempt to discuss the semiautomatic generation of WNs for languages other than English, a topic of great interest since the existence of such WNs will create the appropriate infrastructure for advanced Information Technology systems. Extending the algorithmic approach proposed in [Nikolov and Petrova, 01] we introduce a semiautomatic method based on heuristics for generating noun and adjective synsets and clusters. This choice of involved parts of speech is determined by the fact that nouns and adjectives have completely different organizations in WN: the hierarchy and the N-dimensional hyper-space respectively. Our approach to WN generation relies on so-called \"class methods\", namely it uses as knowledge sources individual entries coming from bilingual dictio� naries and WN synsets, but at the same time demonstrates the need to combine such methods with structural ones.'),

Our approach uses standard UML, algebraic specification and object-oriented implementation to cover the construction of hyperlink structures, from design through to specification and realization.

(392,'On the background of rising Intranet applications the automatic generation of adaptable, context-sensitive hypertexts becomes more and more important [El-Beltagy et al., 2001]. This observation contradicts the literature on hypertext authoring, where Information Retrieval techniques prevail, which disregard any linguistic and context-theoretical underpinning. As a consequence, resulting hypertexts do not manifest those schematic structures, which are constitutive for the emergence of text types and the context-mediated understanding of their instances, i.e. natural language texts. This paper utilizes <i>Systemic Functional Linguistics</i> (SFL) and its context model as a theoretical basis of hypertext authoring. So called <i>Systemic Functional Hypertexts</i> (SFHT) are proposed, which refer to a stratified context layer as the proper source of text linkage. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, hypertexts are reconstructed from a linguistic point of view as a kind of supersign, whose constituents are natural language texts and whose structuring is due to intra- and intertextual coherence relations and their context-sensitive interpretation. Second, the paper prepares a formal notion of SFHTs as a first step towards operationalization of fundamental text linguistic concepts. On this background, SFHTs serve to overcome the theoretical poverty of many approaches to link generation.'),

(395,'Document structures are a crucial mechanism for the creation and the usability of complex hypermedia documents. They form a possibility to deal with the inherent complexity of such documents and with document structures it is also possible to support the reuse of parts of hypermedia documents. In several theoretical approaches different kinds of document structures have been proposed. For example in the Dexter Hypertext Model or in the hypermedia model developed by Klaus Tochtermann. <br><br> In the creation process of such hypermedia documents, which is strongly influenced by the offered functionality of the existing editors and tools, only simple kinds of structures could presently be used. Furthermore the use of hypermedia documents is often somehow connected to special system requirements, which makes it difficult to use these documents in a network. Especially the use of such hypermedia documents in the internet with all its different platforms and operating systems still cause many difficulties. The profit of hypermedia documents could obviously be increased, if broad forms of structuring could be used to build hypermedia documents and when these documents fulfill at the time the demands of interoperability and platform independency. <br><br> This papers presents a contribution to this topic by introducing techniques for the implementation of structured hypermedia documents, which fulfill the demands of system and platform independency. These techniques are consequently based on the Extensible Markup Language. To form the basis for an XML-based implementation of structured hypermedia documents, the concepts of the Tochtermann model were transformed into a XML document type definition. Because we understand the process of creating a hypermedia document as an integrative process, not only the document type definition itself is described, but also the aspects of displaying such a XML-based hypermedia document. Due to the continuous use of XML conform techniques the developed HMDoc hypermedia documents are platform and system independent and can therefore be easily used in networks like the internet.'),

From this perspective, we wish to construct a partition (referred to as the median partition) such that the sum of the dissimilarities between this partition and all the partitions determined by the attributes of the database is minimal.

In this work we use transducers to model noisy channels and consider a few simple transducer operations that can be used to reduce the language properties of error-detection and error-correction to the transducer property of functionality. As a consequence, we obtain simple polynomial-time algorithms for deciding these properties for regular languages. On the other hand the properties are not decidable for context-free languages.

We address here this question. First, we surprisingly find that \"generalized\" symport rules are sufficient: if more than two chemicals pass together through membranes, then we get again the power of Turing machines. Three results of this type are obtained, with a trade-off between the number of chemicals which move together (at least three in the best case) and the number of membranes used. The same result is obtained for standard symport rules (couples of chemicals), if the passing through membranes is conditioned by some permitting contexts (certain chemicals should be present in the membrane). In this case, four membranes suffice. The study of other variants of P systems with symport rules (for instance, with forbidding contexts) is formulated as an open problem.      <hr align=\"left\" width=\"50%\">      1.) C. S. Calude, K.

However, there are some problems derived from the gap between the real world and virtual environment: coordination for discussions, cooperative reactions, comprehension of learning progress, etc. These problems may be dependent on the fact that the actions of students cannot be influenced from the behaviors of others directly. In this paper, we address a coordination mechanism to promote cooperative actions/reactions for progressive discussions. Our idea is to apply an agent-oriented framework to this coordination mechanism and introduce two different types of agents. One is a coordinator and the other is a learner. The coordinator monitors the learning progress of group and promotes the discussion, if necessary, so as to reach their common goal successfully.

The module described is an asynchronous interactive online environment for EFL writing which integrates the potential of computers, Internet, and linguistic analysis to address the highly specific needs of second language composition classes. The system accommodates learners, teachers, and researchers. A crucial consequence of the interactive nature of this system is that users actually create information through their use, and this information enables the system to improve with use. In addition to the tools provided for teachers to mark essays and automatically track the feedback they have given each learner, the system supports the automated capture of a learner corpus of written English in the process. The essays written by users and the comments given by teachers are archived in a searchable online database. Learners can retrieve this information to examine their own recurring problems in the target language. Teachers can do the same in order to discover these problem areas for individual learners and for a class as a whole. The modular system provides interfaces with functions to facilitate an array of user tasks such as teachers\'  correction of essays and learners\'  writing and revision processes. Error analysis of learner essays has led to content creation for automated online help. One sort of help feature can detect certain errors automatically and offer appropriate help pages. Another type of help feature can track the number of times a teacher has marked the same error type in one learner\'s writing and, when this number reaches a threshold, automatically offer help on this error to this learner.'),

From the perspective of knowledge management many sophisticated techniques, concepts, and methodologies developed in the domain of environmental informatics can build the starting point for finding answers to open questions in knowledge management. For example, meta-knowledge management can capitalise on existing results gained in the area of metadata management, which plays a key role in environmental informatics. Up to now, many tools for knowledge processing have been applied in the domain of environmental informatics to help solve environmental problems. New knowledge management tools can improve this situation which in turn contributes directly or indirectly to a significant improvement of the protection of our environment. In order to achieve its objective, the paper introduces knowledge management with a strong focus on information technology. This introduction is followed by a literature survey on knowledge processing in environmental applications. Thereafter, several environmental information systems are analysed in the light of knowledge management. A special emphasis is placed on how geographical information systems can be used for knowledge management.

We define this concept and study its main denotational and computational properties, and also show how the extension of hidden algebra with behavioural coherence still accommodates the coinduction proof method advocated by classical hidden algebra and, very importantly, permits operations with several hidden sorts in the arity. The emphasis of this paper is however on the methodologies related to behavioural coherence. We present the basic methodologies of behavioural coherence by means of examples actually run under the <IMG src=\"behavioural_coherence_in_object/images/img1.gif\"> system, including many proofs with the system exiled to appendices.  </P>       <hr align=\"left\" width=\"50%\">      1 C.S.Calude and G.Stefanescu (eds.). <i>Automata, Logic, and Computability.

(617,'Proving that a program suits its specification and thus can be called <i>correct</i> has been a research subject for many years resulting in a wide range of methods and formalisms. However, it is a common experience that even systems which have been proven correct can fail due to physical faults occurring in the system. As computer programs control an increasing part of todays critical infrastructure, the notion of correctness has been extended to <i>fault tolerance</i>, meaning correctness in the presence of a certain amount of faulty behavior of the environment. Formalisms to verify fault-tolerant systems must model faults and faulty behavior in some form or another.  Common ways to do this are based on a notion of <i>transformation</i> either at the program or the specification level. We survey the wide range of formal methods to verify fault-tolerant systems which are based on some form of transformation.

(618,'The Reliability analysis of information and automation systems has to cope with complex system structures and a large number of different components. Adapted to these requirements, the Markovian minimal cut approach has been developed. The Markovian minimal cut approach combines the advantages of two well-known approaches, the minimal cut and the Markovian path approach. The minimal cut approach allows the efficient evaluation of large scale systems. The Markovian path approach is able to model and evaluate real operation and outage behavior under realistic conditions. It includes outage and disconnection partitions, maintenance strategies (inspection, maintenance, repair), and operation and control strategies, which may lead to complicated stochastic dependencies. The Markovian minimal cut approach reduces the modelling and evaluation effort of real systems significantly because only a small number of Markovian states have to be modelled. In some applications the use of this approach first makes it possible to model and calculate the reliability of the system. The error of the approximations, induced by the Markovian path models have been proven to be less than 0.1% in practical systems. The approximations give the advantage of a result in an analytical context vs. pure computer-based numerical- or simulation-methods.'),

The progress in computing technology enables us to use 64-bit machines with the promise of 128-bit machines in the near future. To exploit fully the technology for fast hashing, we need to be able to design cryptographically strong Boolean functions in many variables which can be evaluated faster using partial evaluations from the previous rounds. We introduce a new class of Boolean functions whose evaluation is especially efficient and we call them rotation symmetric. Basic cryptographic properties of rotation-symmetric functions are investigated in a broader context of symmetric functions. An algorithm for the design of rotation-symmetric functions is given and two classes of functions are examined. These classes are important from a practical point of view as their forms are short. We show that shortening of rotation_symmetric functions paradoxically leads to more expensive evaluation process.'),

This inhomogeneous piece and the non-reproducible and random properties are incorporated into an electronic signature which is checked whenever needed. Assuming that the surface is covered totally with an \"active coating material\" it is impossible to partially penetrate or destroy the coating without destroying the signature. Unpenetrable hardware is an inevitable element in nearly all secure designs and with the promotion of digital signatures such unpenetrable hardware becomes even more important. The result gained with the presented work is the possibility to make a hardware unique depending on randomness, and to assure that penetration is not only detected but also features logical destruction of the secure hardware [PAT96].

The distributions of connection time and elapsed time can be modeled using Pearson, Weibul, or Log-logistic distributions. Response times display strong daily and weekly patterns. We also characterize the effect of a user\'s network bandwidth on response time. Average connection time from a client via a 33.6 K modem is two times longer than that from a client via switched Ethernet. We estimate the elapsed time savings from using persistent connections for a page to vary from about a quarter to a half. This study finds that a proxy caching server is sensitive to traffic loads.

At a logical level, this possibility is realized by permitting implications to be embedded in goals. Program clauses that appear in the antecedents of such implications may contain variables that are bound by external quantifiers, leading to non-local variables in procedure declarations. In compiling programs in this extended language, there is, therefore, a need to consider the addition to given programs of program clauses that are parameterized by bindings for some of their variables. A proposed approach to dealing with this aspect uses a closure representation for clauses. This representation separates an instance of a clause with parameterized bindings into a skeleton part that is fixed at compile-time and an environment that maintains the part that is dynamically determined. A development of this implementation scheme is provided here by starting with an abstract interpreter for the language and then refining this to arrive at an interpreter that uses the closure representation for clauses.

PDP is a recomputation-based model for parallel execution of Prolog on distributed memory. The system exploits OR_parallelism, Independent AND_parallelism as well as the combination of both. The verification process starts from the SLD trees, which define the execution of a Prolog program, and going through the parallel model, it arrives to the abstract machine designed for PDP, an extension of the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine), the most common sequential implementation of Prolog. The first step of this process consists in defining parallel SLD subtrees, which are a kind of partition of the SLD tree for programs whose clauses are annotated with parallelism. In a subsequent step the parallel execution approach of PDP is modeled by means of an OR_TASK ASM. In this ASM each task is associated with the execution of a parallel SLD subtree. The execution of the parallel SLD subtree corresponding to each task is modeled by a NODE submachine which is an extension of the one proposed by Börger and Rosenzweig to verify the sequential execution of Prolog. Accordingly, the verification leans on the results of this work in order to avoid the verification of the common points with the sequential execution. The new elements of the execution due to parallelism exploitation are modeled at successive steps of the verification process, finally leading to the extended WAM which implements PDP.

ProFile filters the netnews and uses a scale of 11 predefined values of relevance. ProFile allows the user to update on--line the profile and to check the discrepancy between the assessment and the prediction of relevance of the system.

The paper further proposes an algorithm for the conversion of T-Code codewords into T-depletion codewords that may be used as a decoder for generalized T-Codes. As well as representing all codewords of a T-Code set (the leaf nodes in the set s decoding tree), the T-depletion code format also permits the representation of \"pseudo-T codewords\" --- strings that are not in the T-Code set.

(785,'This paper formalizes the communication of agents with modal operators in arrow logic. A communication between agents consists of an agent\'s utterance and the other agent\'s perception, thus, both of the utterance and the perception are regarded as parts of a communication channel between agents. Information is regarded as a propositional content of a sentence. An information channel where information flows can be considered to be a program, in the sense that it gets an utterance as an input and puts an output to be a perception of some agent. In the real situations, th ere are so called miscommunications. Thus, the communication channel as a program may add some noise on information indeterministically. We implement the noises are some modal operators on information. We try to formalize the communication channels in arrow logic. In that, we especially pay attention to the following three problems: channel bottleneck, unreliable channel, and reverse information. This paper\'s contribution is two-fold. First, we formalize the theory of information flow, based on situation semantics, in terms of arrow logic. Secondly, we propose the theory of communication channels between agents by using arrow logic, where, classical modal operators like knowledge, belief, and perception are distributed on various places on the communication channel. We discuss the satisfiability and the applicability of our formalization, using the test principles by Barwise on this information flow model.'),

Specific cases of such data structures (like counting networks and concurrent counters) have been studied recently, and such data structures seem to model concurrent systems like client-server applications, in which the identities of the clients, and sometimes also their number, are not known apriori. Specifically, we study the relation between wait-free and bounded wait-free public data structures - the former guarantees that every operation performed on the data structure always terminates, regardless of the relative speed of the processes, the latter guarantees that every such operation is terminated within a fixed number of steps. We present an example of a public data structure which is wait-free but not bounded wait-free, and then we show that if all the concurrent objects of the data structure are periodic, then wait-freedom implies bounded wait-freedom.'),

Existing formal models for hypermedia mostly lack the flexibility and adaptability and, often not more than one existing system conforms to such a model. The DFHM overcomes this drawback by means of optional and alternative data types. The conformance of a hypermedia system to the DFHM can be conditionalised upon one member of the family. The DFHM has been formalised in VDM, but the aim of this paper is to give an informal overview of the main concepts. Therefore, any formalisms are omitted here. The first part of the paper deals with hypermedia fundamentals from a conceptual perspective. Apart from basic concepts, e.g. nodes and links, also structuring concepts, e.g. views, folders and others, are discussed in detail.

In this paper we present evidence indicating that there are many pitfalls on the road to achieve the goal. In particular, we show that certain types of S-boxes which are seemingly very appealing do not exist. We also show that, contrary to previous perception, techniques such as chopping or repeating permutations do not yield cryptographically strong S-boxes. In addition, we reveal an important combinatorial structure associated with certain quadratic permutations, namely, the difference distribution table of each differentially 2-uniform quadratic permutation embodies a Hadamard matrix. As an application of this result, we show that chopping a differentially 2-uniform quadratic permutation results in an S-box that is very prone to the differential cryptanalytic attack.'),

Knowledge acquisition by human beings makes sense only if we take into account the need for socialisation of knowledge and a process that allows the sharing of it.

The kernel plays a role of a fix point very useful for people having roots. The balance between activities taking place in the kernel and the cloud is then analysed. This leads us to discuss some basic principles underlying the global organisation. This kind of approach helps us to specify more precisely different points : teachers\' roles and constraints on teachers\' education.

The translation illustrates the heavy cost in practice of faithfully implementing the communication primitive of the pi-calculus and similar process calculi. It also illustrates the convenience of representing an evolving network of communicating agents directly within a graph manipulation formalism, both because the necessity to use delicate notions of bound variables and of scopes is avoided, and also because the standard model of graphs in set theory automatically yields a useful semantics for the process calculus. The correctness proof illustrates many features typically encountered in reasoning about graph rewriting systems, and particularly how serialisation techniques can be used to reorder an arbitrary execution into one having stated desirable properties.'),

As networks get faster and less congested topologies emerge, it becomes important to use network resources more aggressively to obtain good performance.

In this work we address the issue of file caching in a networked file system configuration. Distributed block-level in-memory caches are considered.

In this kind of scenarios is frequent to see   the appearance of conflicts when modifying the state of a device as   for example a lamp. Those problems are not as much of sharing of   resources as of conflict of orders coming from different   agents. This coexistence must deal also with the desire of privacy   of the different users over their personal information such as where   they are, what their preferences are or to whom this information   should be available.  When facing incompatible orders over the state   of a device it turns necessary to make a decision. In this paper we   propose a centralised mechanism based on prioritized FIFO queues to   decide the order in which the control of a device is granted. The   priority of the commands is calculated following a policy that   considers issues such as the commander\'s role, command\'s type,   context\'s state and commander-context and commander-resource   relations.  Finally we propose a set of particular policies for   those resources that do not adjust to the general policy. In   addition we present a model pretending to integrate privacy through   limiting and protecting contextual information.'),

(953,'The growth of sensor networks during the last years is a fact and within this field, wireless sensor networks are growing particularly as there are many applications that demand the use of many nodes, even hundreds or thousands. More and more applications are emerging to solve several problems in data acquisition and control in different environments, taking advantage of this technology. In this context, hardware design of the sensor network node becomes critical to satisfy the hard constraints imposed by wireless sensor networks, like low power consumption, low size and low cost. Moreover, these nodes must be capable of sensing, processing and communicating physical parameters, becoming true smart sensors in a network. With this goal in mind, we propose a modular architecture for the nodes, composed of four layers: communication, processing, power supply and sensing. The purpose is to minimize the redesign effort as well as to make the node flexible and adaptable to many different applications. In a first prototype of the node, we present a node with a mixed design based on a microcontroller and an FPGA for the processing layer and Bluetooth technology for communications.'),

An example would be to easily adapt existing applications when new communication technologies appear. Current approaches apply component technologies to achieve these goals, but more should be done. Our research focuses on applying aspect technologies to components in order to improve AmI application modularization.

The reason for this is that there are currently     no laws to constrain data mining in any way. We contend that     suitable internationally accepted laws are necessary. In their     absence, mechanisms are necessary to explicitly ensure web content     neutrality (which goes beyond the net neutrality of [Berners-Lee,     2006]) and a balanced distribution of symbolic power [see Couldry,     2003].

Emulators have smaller load/compilation time and are a good solution for their simplicity when speed is not a priority. Compilers are more complex than emulators, and the difference is much more acute if some form of code analysis is performed as part of the compilation, which impacts development time.

Slicing techniques amount, therefore, to (sophisticated) graph transversal algorithms. This paper proposes a completely different approach to the slicing problem for functional programs. Instead of extracting program information to build an underlying dependencies\' structure, we resort to standard program calculation strategies, based on the so-called Bird-Meertens formalism. The slicing criterion is specified either as a projection or a hiding function which, once composed with the original program, leads to the identification of the intended slice.

We present a mapping from the Visitor Pattern to a context free grammar that defines the set of all such visit sequences, a given Visitor can perform. The language defined by this grammar is the language of the Visitor Design Pattern and the mapping encodes knowledge about the class hierarchy and the implementation of the accept methods of a Visitor Design Pattern. It is general enough to model complications that occur when traversing arbitrary object structures, and also properly represents cases such as lack of a common base class, multiple inheritance, and inheritance from concrete classes. Due to its particular design, the grammar can also be used as precise documentation for a Visitor Design Pattern.'),

The main   contribution of the BBCI, which is a non-invasive EEG-based BCI   system, is the use of advanced machine learning techniques that   allow to adapt to the specific brain signatures of each user with   literally no training. In BBCI a calibration session of about 20min   is necessary to provide a data basis from which the individualized   brain signatures are inferred. This is very much in contrast to   conventional BCI approaches that rely on operand conditioning and   need extensive subject training of the order 50-100 hours. Our   machine learning concept thus allows to achieve high quality   feedback already after the very first session. This work reviews a   broad range of investigations and experiments that have been   performed within the BBCI project. In addition to these general   paradigmatic BCI results, this work provides a condensed outline of   the underlying machine learning and signal processing techniques   that make the BBCI succeed. In the first experimental paradgm we   analyze the predictability of limb movement long before the actual   movement takes place using only the movement intention measured from   the pre-movement (readiness) EEG potentials.

Experimental results show that, on average, over 51 percent of an image in the NIST-4 database has reliable orientations.

Classical linear predictors such as FIR and lattice filters, as well as a variety of feedforward and recurrent neural networks are studied.

For our verification purposes, equational reasoning is not valid due to the presence of non-deterministic and partial functions. Our approach transforms functionallogic programs into Maude theories and then uses the Rewriting Logic logical framework to verify properties of the transformed programs. We propose an inductive proving method based on the length of the computation on the Rewriting Logic framework to cope with the non-deterministic and non-terminating aspects of the programs. We illustrate the application of the method on various examples, where we analyze the sequence of steps to be performed by the proof in order to get expertise for the automatization of the process. Then, since the proposed transformation process is also amenable of automatization, we will obtain a tool for proving properties of CRWL programs. Another advantage of our methodology, that distinguish it from other approaches, is that it does not confuse the original functional-logic program with the subjects we want to talk about in the properties, but it allows the equational definition of observations on top of the transformed programs which simplifies the obtained proofs.'),

(1041,'This paper describes a method of using Petri net   P-invariants in system diagnosis. To model this process a net   oriented fault classification is presented. Hence, the considered   discrete event system is modelled by a live, bounded, and reversible   place-transition Petri net. The notions of D-partition of the set   of places P of a given place-transition net N and net   k-distinguishability are first introduced. Next these two notions   are extended to the set of all vertices, i.e. places and transitions   of N. So the problem of fault identification of the vertices of N   is transformed as a problem of fault identification of the places of   a new net N´ called a net simulator of N. Any transition in N´ is   assumed to be fault-free. Then the corresponding net place   invariants are computed. The system k-distinguishability measure is   obtained in a unique way from the place-invariant matrix. For a   large value of k, the system model is extended by using some set of   additional places called test points and at the same time preserving   the original net properties. To obtain a 1-distinguishable net the   notion of a marked graph component is used. It is shown a sufficient   condition for 1-distinguishability of an arbitrary place-transition   net and a corresponding algorithm is presented. Next two different   diagnosis test strategies are discussed, i.e. combinational and   sequential fault diagnosis. Corresponding (single) place and   transition fault models are introduced. The complexity of the   proposed method depends on the effectivity of the existing   algorithms for computation of the P-cover, i.e. the set of   P-invariants covering N. The proposed approach can be extended for   higher level Petri nets, e.g such as coloured nets or also to design   self-diagnosable circuit realisations of Boolean interpreted Petri   nets. Several examples are given.'),

(1055,'Some sensor systems are characterized by multiple simultaneous aperiodic emissions, with low signal-to-noise ratio and asynchronous detection. In these systems, complementary sets of sequences can be used to encode emissions, due to their suitable auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties. The transmission of a complementary set can be accomplished by interleaving the sequences of the set, generating a macro-sequence which is easily transmitted by a BPSK modulation. The detection of the macrosequence can be performed by means of efficient correlation algorithms with a notably decreased computational load and hardware complexity. This work presents a new hardware design in configurable logic of an efficient correlator for macrosequences generated from complementary sets of sequences. A generic implementation has been achieved, so the configuration can be changed according to the requirements of the application.

Those tasks   usually perform computations (with loop intensive behavior) and   produce new data to be consumed by subsequent tasks. This paper   shows a scheme to pipeline sequences of data-dependent loops, in   such a way that subsequent loops can start execution before the   completion of the previous ones, which achieves performance   improvements. It uses a hardware scheme with decoupled and   concurrent data-path and control units that start execution at the   same time. The communication of array elements between two loops in   sequence is performed by special buffers with a data-driven,   fine-grained scheme. Buffer elements are responsible to flag the   availability of each array element requested by a subsequent loop   (i.e., a ready protocol is used to trigger the execution of   operations in the succeeding loop). Thus, the control execution of   following loops is also orchestrated by data availability (in this   case at the array element grain) and out-of-order produced-consumed   pairs are permitted. The concept has been applied using Nau, a   compiler infrastructure to map algorithms described in Java onto   FPGAs.

(1070,'Nowadays, advanced E-Learning systems are generally pedagogy-aware. Commonly, these systems include facilities for defining so-called learning scenarios that reflect sophisticated pedagogical approaches such as collaborative writing or project-oriented learning. To support different learning activities from such scenarios the technological infrastructure of these systems must be appropriately adjusted and configured. Usually, this configuration process is laced with a number of difficulties. Most of these difficulties are caused by the fact that scenario capturing is achieved through informal user-developer dialogues. Typically, the result of such informal dialogues contains inconsistent and incomplete information because of misunderstandings and the complexity of the interactions within a scenario. Consequently, the configuration of the system is suboptimal and a number of iterations are required in order to achieve better results. In this paper an approach to improve this situation is presented. This approach is based on a general formal representation model for describing learning scenarios. A particular formal description of a concrete learning scenario is obtained through a user dialogue with a wizard tool. At the next step, this formal description might be automatically processed to facilitate configuration process.

However, its adoption   and extensive use in real practice largely depends on the extent to   which teachers can design and author their own UoLs according to the   requirements of their educational situations. Many of the proposed   design processes for facilitating the creation of UoLs are based on   the reuse of complete or non-complete learning design solutions at   different levels of granularity. This paper introduces a comparison   framework that conceptually analyzes and classifies reusable   learning design solutions and processes that drive the creation of   ready-to-run UoLs. The framework provides a comprehensible   representation of such processes and units of reuse over two   dimensions, namely granularity and completeness. It also offers a   frame for discussing issues, such as the proper level of reuse, of   existing and forthcoming proposals. Finally, it opens the path to   other strands for future research such as providing language   independence of learning designs or proposing approaches for the   selection of the reusable solutions.'),

Recently, this    technology has been applied to Wireless Communication Systems    (WCS), where efficient resource allocation is a primary goal, for    modelling the physical entities involved, like Base Stations (BS),    service providers and network operators. This paper presents a    novel approach in applying MAS methodology to WCS resource    allocation by modelling more abstract entities involved in WCS    operation, and especially the concurrent network procedures    (services). Due to the concurrent nature of a WCS, MAS technology    presents a suitable modelling solution. Services such as new call    admission, handoff, user movement and call termination are    independent to one another and may occur at the same time for many    different users in the network. Thus, the required network    procedures for supporting the above services act autonomously,    interact with the network environment (gather information such as    interference conditions), take decisions (e.g. call establishment),    etc, and can be modelled as agents. Based on this novel simulation    approach, the agent cooperation in terms of negotiation and    agreement becomes a critical issue. To this end, two negotiation    strategies are presented and evaluated in this research effort and    among them the distributed negotiation and communication scheme    between network agents is presented to be highly efficient in terms    of network performance. The multi-agent concept adapted to the    concurrent nature of large scale WCS is, also, discussed in this    paper.'),

For the   analysis phase a Card Sorting module (open  closed) has been   developed that uses the hierarchical and multidimensional cluster   analysis, which allows a better information architecture. For the   evaluation phases, modules have been developed that allow the   semiautomatic evaluation of usability through user satisfaction   tests based on Nielsen heuristics and ISO standards, the evaluation   of accessibility through the verification of WCAG 1.0   guidelines.

(1284,'Feature selection methods are often applied in the context of document classification. They are particularly important for processing large data sets that may contain millions of documents and are typically represented by a large number, possibly tens of thousands of features. Processing large data sets thus raises the issue of computational resources and we often have to find the right trade-off between the size of the feature set and the number of training data that we can taken into account. Furthermore, depending on the selected classification technique, different feature selection methods require different optimization approaches, raising the issue of compatibility between the two. We demonstrate an effective classifier training and feature selection method that is suitable for large data collections. We explore feature selection based on the weights obtained from linear classifiers themselves, trained on a subset of training documents. While most feature weighting schemes score individual features independently from each other, the weights of linear classifiers incorporate the relative importance of a feature for classification as observed for a given subset of documents thus taking the feature dependence into account. We investigate how these feature selection methods combine with various learning algorithms. Our experiments include a comparative analysis of three learning algorithms: Na&#239;ve Bayes, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in combination with three feature weighting methods: Odds ratio, Information Gain, and weights from the linear SVM and Perceptron. We show that by regulating the size of the feature space (and thus the sparsity of the resulting vector representation of the documents) using an effective feature scoring, like linear SVM, we need only a half or even a quarter of the computer memory to train a classifier of almost the same quality as the one obtained from the complete data set. Feature selection using weights from the linear SVMs yields a better classification performance than other feature weighting methods when combined with the three learning algorithms. The results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature weighting method rather than its compatibility with the learning algorithm that improves the classification performance.'),

So far, most adaptation approaches which deal with behavioural mismatches work on a fixed description of components where all ports involved in their interfaces are known at design-time.

One appropriate   technique for Software Adaptation is Aspect-Oriented Programming   (AOP) which makes use of aspects to facilitate the dynamic   adaptation of components transparently and non-intrusively.

The APS process runs periodically in a cycle, in which   phases of agent\'s normal performance intertwine with learning   phases. During the former ones an agent stores observations in a   history. After a learning phase has been triggered, the history   facts are analyzed to yield new association rules, which are added   to the knowledge base by the maintenance algorithm. Then the old   observations are removed from the history, so that in the next   learning runs only recent facts are processed in search of new   association rules. Keeping the history small can save both   processing time and disk space as compared to batch learning   approaches.'),

The second oneis called the personal model, or   writer-dependent, which very often performs better but needs a   bigger number of samples per writer. Experiments on a database   composed of short articlesfrom 30 different authors and Support   Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier demonstrate that the proposed   strategy can produced results comparable to the   literature.'),
(1360,'In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a   system capable of recognizing words extracted from ultra low   resolution images such as those frequently embedded on web   pages. The design of the system has been driven by the following   constraints. First, the system has to recognize small font sizes   between 6-12 points where anti-aliasing and resampling filters are   applied. Such procedures add noise between adjacent characters in   the words and complicate any a priori segmentation of the   characters. Second, the system has to be able to recognize any words   in an open vocabulary setting, potentially mixing different   languages in Latin alphabet. Finally, the training procedure must be   automatic, i.e. without requesting to extract, segment and label   manually a large set of data. These constraints led us to an   architecture based on ergodic HMMs where states are associated to   the characters. We also introduce several improvements of the   performance increasing the order of the emission probability   estimators, including minimum and maximum width constraints on the   character models and a training set consisting all possible   adjacency cases of Latin characters. The proposed system is   evaluated on different font sizes and families, showing good   robustness for sizes down to 6 points.'),

In our experiment, we asked our subjects to use only the dominant hand to achieve the different tasks or, on the contrary, to use both hands.

The third category is the content-based watermarking authentication schemes in which the watermark is generated by the multimedia content.

(1417,'A distinguishing feature of today\'s large-scale platforms for multimedia distribution and communication, such as the Internet, is their heterogeneity, predominantly manifested by the fact that a variety of communication protocols are simultaneously running over different hosts. A fundamental question that naturally arises for such common settings of heterogeneous multimedia systems concerns the presence (or not) of stability properties when individual greedy, contention-resolution protocols are composed in a large packet-switched multimedia network. A network is stable under a greedy protocol (or a composition of protocols) if, for any adversary of injection rate less than 1, the number of packets in the network remains bounded at all times. We focus on a basic adversarial model for packet arrival and path determination for which the time-averaged arrival rate of packets requiring a single edge is no more than 1. Within this framework, we study the property of stability under various compositions of contention-resolution protocols (such as LIS (<I>Longest-in-System</I>), FIFO (<I>First-In-First-Out</I>), FFS (<I>Furthest-from-Source</I>), and NTG (<I>Nearest-to-Go</I>)) and different packet trajectories trying to characterise this property in terms of network topologies. Such a characterisation provides us with the family of network topologies that, under specific compositions of protocols, can be made unstable by some adversarial traffic pattern. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of the stability behaviour of specific network constructions with different protocol compositions under an adversarial strategy. Interestingly, some of our results indicate that such a composition leads to worst stability behaviour than having a single unstable protocol for contention-resolution. This suggests that the potential for instability incurred by the composition of protocols may be worse than that of any single protocol.'),

(1439,'In this paper a novel technique for identifying   lexical contexts in web resources is presented. The basic idea is to   consider web site anchortexts as lexicalized descriptions of an   individual ontology organized in the form of a graph of concept   words. In the search for peculiar semantic patterns, the concept of   web minutia (transposed from the forensic domain) is introduced. The   proposed technique consists in searching for web minutiae in the   analyzed web sites by means of a golden ontology. Web minutiae act   as fingerprints for context-specific web resources; in this sense   they are a powerful computational tool to identify and categorize   the Web. The WordNet database has been used as golden ontology for   our experiments on English web documents. WordNet allows for   indexing and retrieving word senses and inter-word taxonomical   relations like hyponymy and hypernymy. It has proven to be an   efficient mediator between web ontologies and context-dependent   taxonomies. Our experiments have been carried out on a preliminary   data set of several tens of thousand links taken by web sites of   thirteen UK universities. Preliminary results seem to confirm the   ability of web minutiae to identify lexical contexts across the Web.'),

When time-course data is available, gene interactions   may be modeled by a Bayesian Network (BN). Given a structure, that   models the conditional independence between genes, we can tune the   parameters in a way that maximize the likelihood of the observed   data. The structure that best fit the observed data reflects the   real gene network\'s connections. Well known learning algorithms   (greedy search and simulated annealing) devoted to BN structure   learning have been used in literature. We enhanced the fundamental   step of structure learning by means of a classical evolutionary   algorithm, named GA (Genetic algorithm), to evolve a set of   candidate BN structures and found the model that best fits data,   without prior knowledge of such structure. In the context of genetic   algorithms, we proposed various initialization and evolutionary   strategies suitable for the task. We tested our choices using   simulated data drawn from a gene simulator, which has been used in   the literature for benchmarking [Yu et al. (2002)].

The performances of the   different evolutionary algorithms have been compared against the   traditional search algorithms used so far (greedy search and   simulated annealing).

We show that this approach outperforms classical structure learning   methods in elucidating the original model of the simulated dataset.

(1441,'Recently, classifier ensemble methods are   gaining more and more attention in the machine-learning and   data-mining communities. In most cases, the performance of an   ensemble is better than a single classifier. Many methods for   creating diverse classifiers were developed during the past   decade. When these diverse classifiers are generated, it is   important to select the proper base classifier to join the   ensemble. Usually, this selection process is called pruning the   ensemble. In general, the ensemble pruning is a selection process in   which an optimal combination will be selected from many existing   base classifiers. Some base classifiers containing useful   information may be excluded in this pruning process. To avoid this   problem, the multilayer ensemble pruning model is used in this   paper. In this model, the pruning of one layer can be seen as a   multimodal optimization problem. A novel multi-sub-swarm particle   swarm optimization (MSSPSO) is used here to find multi-solutions for   this multilayer ensemble pruning model. In this model, each base   classifier will generate an oracle output. Each layer will use   MSSPSO algorithm to generate a different pruning based on previous   oracle output. A series of experiments using UCI dataset is   conducted, the experimental results show that the multilayer   ensemble pruning via MSSPSO algorithm can improve the generalization   performance of the multi-classifiers ensemble system.

The overall goal of this research is to classify vehicles along the I215 freeway in Salt Lake City, USA. This information will be used to predict future roadway needs and the expected life of a roadway. The classification of vehicles will be performed by a synthesis of multiple sets of features. All feature sets have not yet been determined; however, one such set will be the reduced wavelet transform of the image of a vehicle. In order to use such a feature, it is necessary that the image be normalized with respect to size, position, and so on. For example, a car in the right most lane in an image will appear smaller than one in the left most lane, because the right most lane is closest to the camera. Likewise, a vehicle?s size will vary depending on where in a lane its image is captured. In our case, the image capture area for each lane is approximately 100 feet of roadway. A goal of this paper is to normalize the image of a vehicle so that regardless of its lane or position in a lane, the features will be approximately the same. The wavelet transform itself will not be used directly for recognition. Instead, it will be input to a neural network and the output of the neural network will be one element of the feature set used for recognition.'),
